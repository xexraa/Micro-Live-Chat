# Micro Live-Chat

Micro Live-Chat is a website that enables anonymous communication with other users. The website has a user-friendly interface, and users can access the chat without needing to log in. Simply enter your name and join the chat that interests you. If you make a mistake in the form, a flash message will inform you where you went wrong.

## Getting Started
To get started, simply visit the Micro Live-Chat website and enter your name. Once you've joined a chat, you can communicate with other users in real-time. If you want to create a private room, generate a unique code by joining in private-room and share it with others.

Once you enter a chat, you can engage in live conversations with other users. The website also displays who joins and leaves the chat, as well as the date and time of each message.

From a technical standpoint, Micro Live-Chat uses a basic version of a database that is stored in the computer's memory. Therefore, when the program is restarted, the database is cleared, and messages are not stored.
